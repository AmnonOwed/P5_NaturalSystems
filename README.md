Natural Systems & Phenomena
=======================

This repo will contain all the code experiments that fall within my Natural Systems research branch.

A huge source of inspiration for this repo is the book [Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/book/) by Daniel Shiffman.

Code examples are written for Processing 1.5.1. and/or Processing 2.0b9.
